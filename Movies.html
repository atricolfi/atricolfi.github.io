<li><em> I have to remind myself that some birds aren't meant to be caged. Their feathers are just too bright. 
  And when they fly away, the part of you that knows it was a sin to lock them up does rejoice. 
  Still, the place you live in is that much more drab and empty that they're gone</em>.<br>

  Makers of men, creators of leaders- be careful what kind of leaders you're producing here. I don't know if Charlie's

  out to buy his future! And that, my friends, is called integrity. That's called courage. 
  Now that's the stuff leaders should be made of</em>.<br>
