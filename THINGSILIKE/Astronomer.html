<em> When I heard the learn’d astronomer,  <br>
When the proofs, the figures, were ranged in columns before me,  <br>
When I was shown the charts and diagrams, to add, divide, and measure them,  <br>
When I sitting heard the astronomer where he lectured with much applause in the lecture-room,  <br>
How soon unaccountable I became tired and sick,  <br>
Till rising and gliding out I wander’d off by myself,  <br>
In the mystical moist night-air, and from time to time,  <br>
Look’d up in perfect silence at the stars.</em> <br><br>
