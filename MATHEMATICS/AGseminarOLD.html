Title: <em>Geometry of tensor network varieties</em>
  <br>
  <br>
Abstract: Tensor network varieties are varieties of tensors described by the combinatorial structure of a graph. 
  They play a major role in quantum many-body physics as well as in other areas of applied mathematics, such as algebraic 
  complexity theory and algebraic statistics.
In this seminar, I will introduce tensor network varieties, focusing on their geometric structure. 
I will show how to study their dimension, equations, and special subvarieties of interest.

Title: <em>Weyl cycles on blow-ups of projective 4-spaces</em>
   <br>
  <br>
Abstract:  I will introduce the definition of Weyl cycles on the blow-up X of P^n in a collection of points in general position. 
   These are irreducible components of the intersection of pairwise orthogonal effective divisors on X that live 
   in the Weyl orbit of exceptional divisors, where the orthogonality is taken with respect to a Dolgachev-Mukai pairing 
   on the Picard group of X. In the case where X is a Mori dream space of dimension four or less, we can describe the geometry 
   of and classify these objects. I will also explain how this relates to certain polynomial interpolation problems.
This is joint work with M. C. Brambilla and O. Dumitrescu.

Title: <em>Cox rings and Algebraic stacks</em>
   <br>
  <br>
Abstract:  In the talk I will discuss the notion of Cox ring for an algebraic stack, 
  which extends the classical notion for varieties, via the language of torsors. 
  I will then present some applications and possible direction of research.

Title: <em>Higher rank K-theoretic Donaldson-Thomas invariants of points</em>
  <br>
  <br>
Abstract: A classical way to produce (numerical) invariants is through intersection theory, 
  usually on a smooth projective variety. We give a gentle introduction on how to use torus 
  actions to refine invariants in several directions, for example K-theoretic and virtual invariants. 
  As a concrete example, we explain how to extract meaningful invariants from the Quot schemes of quasi-projective 
  smooth toric threefolds and how to refine them. We present and prove various closed formulas for different 
  flavours of higher rank Donaldson-Thomas invariants of points, solving a series of conjectures proposed in String Theory. 
  This is based on joint work with N. Fasola and A. Ricolfi.

Title: <em>Geometry of genus 1 fine compactified Jacobians</em>
  <br>
  <br>
Abstract:  A classical construction in algebraic geometry associates with every nonsingular complex projective curve its Jacobian, 
  a complex projective variety of dimension equal to the genus of the curve. A similar construction is available for singular curves, 
  but the resulting Jacobian variety fails in general to be compact. In this talk we introduce a general abstract notion of fine 
  compactified Jacobian for nodal curves of arbitrary genus. We focus on genus 1 and discuss combinatorial classification 
  results for fine compactified Jacobians in the case of a single stable curve, and in the case of the universal family over 
  the moduli space of stable pointed curves.  In the former case, our abstract notion finds back objects that had 
  already been constructed by Oda-Seshadri and others. In the latter case our complete classification exhibits new examples. 
  We then discuss how to calculate the cohomology of these compactified Jacobians. A joint work with Orsola Tommasi.

Title: <em>Torus actions from the viewpoint of birational geometry</em>
  <br>
  <br>
Abstract:  In this talk we focus on complex, smooth, projective varieties  admitting a non-trivial C*-action. 
    We introduce a new approach to investigate such varieties, using instruments coming from birational geometry.
    In particular, we relate small bandwidth varieties with Atiyah flips and special Cremona transformations. 
    We report recent classification results of small bandwidth varieties, with particular  attention to the case of 
    bandwidth 3. We finally discuss some  applications, in the framework of LeBrun-Salamon conjecture. This is a 
    joint project with G. Occhetta, L. Solá Conde and J. Wiśniewski.

Title: <em>Gale duality, blowups and moduli spaces</em>
  <br>
  <br>
Abstract:  The Gale correspondence provides a duality between sets of n points in projective spaces <b>P</b><sup>s</sup> and 
        <b>P</b><sup>r</sup> when n=r+s+2. For small values of s, this duality has a remarkable geometric manifestation: 
        the blowup of <b>P</b><sup>r</sup> at n points can be realized as a moduli space of vector bundles on the blowup of <b>P</b><sup>s</sup> 
        at the Gale dual points. We explore this realization to describe the birational geometry of blowups 
        of projective spaces at points in very general position. We will focus in particular on the cases 
        where the blowup fails to be a Mori Dream Space, reporting on a joint work with Carolina Araujo, Ana-Maria Castravet and Inder Kaur.

Title: <em>Higher rank motivic Donaldson-Thomas invariants</em>
  <br>
  <br>
Abstract:  We define the Grothendieck ring of varieties and the power structure on it. We then present some formulae
      expressing the naive motive of the Quot scheme of points on a 3-fold, as opposed to its <em>virtual motive</em>,
      also known as <em>motivic Donaldson-Thomas invariant</em>. In the virtual setup, we will focus mainly on the case of
      affine 3-space, on which the global case is suitably modelled. The final formula for the generating function of 
      the virtual motives fully solves the higher rank DT theory of a pair (X,F) = (3-fold,vector bundle).

Title: <em>Intrinsic Grassmannians</em>
  <br>
  <br>
Abstract:  Generalizing the well-known weighted Grassmanians introduced by Corti and Reid, we study certain geometric 
      invariant theory quotients of the affine cone over the Plücker embedding of Gr(k,n). More precisely, 
      we consider normal projective varieties whose Cox ring is defined by the Plücker ideal I_{k,n}. For k = 2, 
      we classify the smooth Fano ones having Picard number two and give a concrete formula to compute their number for arbitrary n.

Title: <em>On deformations and moduli of Fano varieties</em>
  <br>
  <br>
Abstract:  Fano varieties are complex projective varieties with "positive curvature". They have a prominent role in algebraic geometry 
   for many reasons, there are very few of them, they constitute the basic building blocks of algebraic varieties.
   In this talk I will explain how their complex structure deforms and how it is possible to construct singular points 
   in the moduli space of K-polystable Fano varieties (i.e. Fano varieties admitting a Kähler-Einstein metric).
   This is joint work with Anne-Sophie Kaloghiros.

Title: <em>Exact solutions in low-rank approximation with zeros</em>
  <br>
  <br>
Abstract:  Low-rank approximation with zeros aims to find a matrix of fixed rank and with a fixed zero pattern that minimizes 
  the Euclidean distance to a given data matrix. We study the critical points of this optimization problem using algebraic tools. 
  In particular, we describe special linear, affine and determinantal relations satisfied by the critical points. We also 
  investigate the number of critical points and how the number is related to the complexity of nonnegative matrix factorization problem. 
  This talk is based on a recent preprint together with Luca Sodomaco and Elias Tsigaridas.

Title: <em>Complete quadrics: Schubert calculus for Gaussian models and semidefinite programming</em>
  <br>
  <br>
Abstract:  Algebraic geometry has made great advances in the last two centuries. A particular role was 
  played by enumerative geometry, where correct setting of moduli spaces found applications beyond mathematics.
  In my talk I would like to present a new work on applications of enumerative geometry in algebraic statistics. 
  The main role will be played by the classical variety of complete quadrics and its cohomology ring. However, 
  inspired by algebraic statistics, we will look at it from a different perspective, namely what happens when 
  the dimension of the quadric changes. We will present two theorems, confirming conjectures posed by Nie, Ranestad, 
  Sturmfels and Uhler. Achieving our results would not be possible without the fundamental work of De Concini, Laksov, 
  Lascoux, Pragacz and Procesi. The talk is based on joint works with Manivel, Monin, Seynnaeve, Vodicka and Wisniewski.

Title: <em>On secant defectiveness of toric varieties</em>
  <br>
  <br>
Abstract:  Let N be a free abelian group, M = Hom(N,Z) its dual, M_Q := M ⊗ Q the corresponding rational vector space, 
    P ⊆ M_Q a full dimensional lattice polytope, and (X_P , H) the corresponding polarized toric variety. 
    We study the secant defectiveness of X_P in the embedding induced by H. In particular, we give a bound, depending 
    only on the maximum number of integer points on a facet of P, for the non secant defectiveness of X_P. 
    Furthermore, as an application, we get an almost asymptotically sharp bound for the non secant defectiveness of Segre-Veronese varieties.

    Title: <em>Togliatti systems, Weak Lefschetz Property and Galois coverings</em>
    <br>
    <br>
    Abstract: In an article in collaboration with Rosa M. Mirò-Roig and Giorgio Ottaviani (Canad. J. Math. 65, 2013), 
       we established a relation, due to apolarity, between Artinian homogeneous ideals of a polynomial ring not satisfying 
       the Weak Lefschetz Property - WLP - and projective varieties that verify a Laplace equation of a certain order s, i.e. 
       such that all the s-osculating spaces have dimension less than expected. Thanks to this relation, it is possible to 
       extend to various classes of toric varieties some classical results due to Eugenio Togliatti. In the seminar, I will 
       introduce these notions and I will speak of some recent results in collaboration with Liena Colarte and 
       Rosa M. Miro'-Roig, relating them to Galois cyclic coverings.

    Title: <em>Tangential weak defectiveness and generic identifiability</em>
    <br>
    <br>
    Abstract: We study the uniqueness of decomposition of general tensors T as a sum of tensors of rank 1. This is done by 
    extending the theory developed in a previous work by Mella to the framework of non-tangentially-weak-defective varieties. 
    In particular, the infinitesimal behaviour of the tangential contact locus is linked to the birational geometry of a 
    weakly defective but not tangentially defective variety. In this way it is possible to prove the non generic identifiability
    of infinitely many partially symmetric tensors.

      Title: <em>Primary ideals and their differential equations</em>
      <br>
      <br>
    Abstract: An ideal in a polynomial ring encodes a system of linear partial differential equations with constant coefficients. 
      Primary decomposition organizes the solutions to the PDE. This paper develops a novel structure theory for primary ideals 
      in a polynomial ring. We characterize primary ideals in terms of PDE, punctual Hilbert schemes, relative Weyl algebras, 
      and the join construction. Solving the PDE described by a primary ideal amounts to computing Noetherian operators in the 
      sense of Ehrenpreis and Palamodov. We develop new algorithms for this task, and we present efficient implementations.

    Title: <em>Subvarieties of general hypersurfaces and their degree of irrationality</em>
      <br>
      <br>
    Abstract: I will be interested in discussing various birational invariants describing how a given variety X is far from being rational. 
      After introducing these invariants, I will focus on the case where X is a general hypersurface of large degree in the complex projective space. 
      In particular, I will report on recent results in collaboration with C. Ciliberto, F. Flamini and P. Supino, concerning the least degree 
      of irrationality of irreducible subvarieties of X of fixed dimension passing through a general point of X.

      Title: <em>Zero-sum cycles in flexible polyhedra</em>
      <br>
      <br>
    Abstract:  We show that if a polyhedron in the three-dimensional affine space with triangular faces is flexible, 
      i.e., can be continuously deformed preserving the shape of its faces, then there is a cycle of edges whose 
      lengths sum up to zero once suitably weighted by 1 and -1. We do this via elementary combinatorial considerations, 
      made possible by a well-known compactification of the three-dimensional affine space as a quadric in the 
      four-dimensional projective space. The compactification is related to the Euclidean metric, and allows us 
      to use a simple degeneration technique that reduces the problem to its one-dimensional analogue, which is trivial 
      to solve. This is a joint work with G. Grasegger, J. Legerský, and J. Schicho.
